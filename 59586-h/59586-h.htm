<p>
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">There is not in all the north countrie,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 20em;">Nor yet on the Humber line,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">A town with a prouder record than</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 20em;">Newcastle-upon-the-Tyne.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">Roman eagles have kept its walls;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 20em;">Saxon, and Dane, and Scot</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">Have left the glamour of noble deeds,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 20em;">With their names on this fair spot.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">From the reign of William Rufus,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 20em;">The monarchs of every line</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">Had a grace for loyal Newcastle,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 20em;">The city upon the Tyne.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">By the Nuns' Gate, and up Pilgrim Street,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 20em;">What pageants have held their way!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">But in seventeen hundred and sixty-three,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 20em;">One lovely morn in May,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">There was a sight in bonnie Newcastle!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 20em;">Oh, that I had been there!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">To hear the call of the trumpeters</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 20em;">Thrilling the clear spring air,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">To hear the roar of the cannon,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 20em;">And the drummer's gathering beat,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">And the eager hum of the multitudes</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 20em;">Waiting upon the street.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">Just at noon was a tender hush,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 20em;">And a funeral march was heard;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">With arms reversed and colors tied,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 20em;">Came the men of the Twenty-third.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">And Lennox, their noble leader, bore</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 20em;">The shreds of a faded flag,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">The battle-flag of the regiment,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 20em;">Shot to a glorious rag;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">Shot into shreds upon its staff,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 20em;">Torn in a hundred fights,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">From the torrid plains of India</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 20em;">To the cold Canadian heights.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">There was not an inch of bunting left;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 20em;">How could it float again</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">Over the faithful regiment</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 20em;">It never had led in vain?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">And oh, the hands that had carried it!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 20em;">It was not cloth and wood;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">It stood for a century's heroes,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 20em;">And was crimson with their blood;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">It stood for a century's comrades.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 20em;">They could not cast it away,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">And so with a soldier's honors</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 20em;">They were burying it that day.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">In the famous old North Humber fort,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 20em;">Where the Roman legions trod,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">With the roar of cannon and roll of drums</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 20em;">They laid it under the sod.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">But it wasn't a tattered flag alone</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 20em;">They buried with tender pride;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">It was every faithful companion</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 20em;">That under the flag had died.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">It was honor, courage, and loyalty</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 20em;">That thrilled that mighty throng</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">Standing bare-headed and silent as</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 20em;">The old flag passed along.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">So when the grasses had covered it,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 20em;">There was a joyful strain;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">And the soldiers, stirred to a noble thought,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 20em;">Marched proudly home again.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">The citizens went to their shops once more,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 20em;">The collier went to his mine;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">The shepherd went to the broomy hills,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 20em;">And the sailor to the Tyne;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">But men and women and children felt</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 20em;">That it had been well to be</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">Just for an hour or two face to face</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 20em;">With honor and loyalty.</span><br />

<h2><a name="A_TERRIBLE_EXPERIENCE" id="A_TERRIBLE_EXPERIENCE">A TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE.</a></h2>

<h3>BY ALLAN FORMAN.</h3>

<p>One rainy day, as the children were amusing themselves by ransacking
their uncle Harry's closets, Tom pulled his hand out suddenly from the
back part of a deep drawer, and shouted triumphantly, "Preserves!" at
the same time holding out a large glass jar for inspection. A cry of
disgust followed, for instead of preserves there was nothing in the
bottle but a strange-looking animal floating in some brown liquid.</p>

<p>"Pah! It's a horrid bug," said Alice, turning up her nose in disgust.</p>

<p>"'Tain't," contradicted Charlie, regardless of his grammar. "It's a
tarantula."</p>

<p>"And what is that but a bug?" replied Alice.</p>

<p>"It's a spider," said Charlie. "You ask Uncle Harry if it isn't."</p>

<p>In the mean time Tom and Alice had taken the jar over to the desk where
Uncle Harry was writing.</p>

<p>"What is this, Uncle Harry?" said Alice.</p>

<p>"It is a tarantula. I brought it home from California with me."</p>

<p>"I told you so!" exclaimed Charlie, from the closet.</p>

<p>"It is a kind of spider, and one of the largest that lives in this
country. They don't make webs like ordinary spiders, but dig a hole in
the ground and line it with a sort of silky web like the cocoon of a
silk-worm. Their hole is about six inches deep, and is closed by a funny
little trap-door made of the same silky lining, and covered on the
outside with sticks and gravel so cleverly that one can rarely find a
tarantula's burrow unless you see him going in; and even if you do see
him going in, it is very difficult to get him to come out, as he pulls
his trap-door shut after him, and holds it tight from the inside."</p>

<p>"If he don't build a web, how does he catch flies and things?" inquired
Charlie.</p>

<p>"He jumps after them. A lively tarantula can jump from three to five
feet, and when he once catches hold of any kind of a bug or small bird
with those great hairy legs, it has but little chance to get away."</p>

<p>"Is their bite really so poisonous?" asked Alice, eying the jar rather
timidly, as if she was afraid the terrible insect would get away.</p>

<p>"That question is a hard one to answer. Some people who have lived in
countries where they are common claim that it is only fatal in a few
cases, while others seem to think it is deadly poison."</p>

<p>"What are you laughing at, Uncle Harry?" demanded Charlie.</p>

<p>"I was thinking of the most horrible night I ever experienced," replied
his uncle. "You know," he continued, "while I was in the West I spent
some two weeks camping out in the mountains with a party of four young
men. We had an old cabin, where we slept at night, and we spent our days
delightfully, fishing, hunting, geologizing, and botanizing. We had not
been in camp long before we discovered a tarantula village not far from
our cabin, and we all determined to catch some specimens to take home
with us. At first we had considerable trouble in catching them; they
were so lively and so ugly that we always ended in killing them in
self-defense. At last a brilliant member of the party discovered that by
placing a wide-mouthed bottle over the mouth of the tarantula's burrow,
and then thumping on the ground around it, the animal would crawl out
into the bottle, and the captor could turn the bottle over, clap a piece
of board over the top, and secure his prisoner. As soon as the discovery
was made known, all the old pickle jars were called into requisition,
and as the former occupants of the cabin had left a number, we were soon
lucky, or unlucky, enough to have about twenty-five large specimens. We
covered the jars with bits of shingle, and set them on a shelf<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_707" id="Page_707">[Pg 707]</a></span> which
was nailed to one side of the cabin. Everything went well, and we
determined that as soon as we had leisure we would kill them with
chloroform, and preserve them in spirits as that one is. But one night,
after we had all got comfortably settled for sleep, one of the party
thought that he was thirsty, so rising carefully from his bunk, he
groped his way over to the corner, under the shelf, where the water-pail
stood; he had his drink, and forgetting the existence of the shelf,
raised his head. Crash! down came the rotten old shelf, and down came
the jars with the tarantulas in them. The party heard the fall, and like
one man sprang from their beds and rushed for the door, but before they
had got half-way across the floor they remembered that the tarantulas
were loose, and they stopped; a moment more and it was too late. We were
all afraid to move, for fear that we would put our feet on a tarantula;
so there we stood, as if turned into statues. In a short time our
positions became strained and cramped, but we did not dare to change
them. Our nerves became excited, and we imagined that we could feel them
crawling up our backs and walking over our bare feet. The minutes seemed
lengthened to hours, and the hours seemed months. At last the day began
to break, but we had manufactured curtains out of old newspapers, that
we might sleep undisturbed by the light. Oh, how we bemoaned our
laziness! Finally it grew light enough to see, and we carefully opened
the door and went out. One of the party went back into the cabin and got
our clothes, and after examining them carefully we dressed ourselves."</p>

<p>"And nobody was bitten?" said Alice, with a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>"No," replied her uncle, rising from his chair as the supper-bell rang;
"but I don't think I ever was so badly scared before or since."</p>

<h2><a name="PLANTS_AND_ANIMALS_THEIR_DIFFERENCE" id="PLANTS_AND_ANIMALS_THEIR_DIFFERENCE">PLANTS AND ANIMALS&mdash;THEIR DIFFERENCE.</a></h2>

<h3>BY MRS. S.&nbsp;B. HERRICK.</h3>

</div>

<p>If the question were put to you suddenly, "What is the difference
between a plant and an animal?" how do you think you would answer? Stop
a minute, and think. Do not be satisfied with saying that a plant has
leaves, and an animal has not. Look deeper, and answer more
thoughtfully. There are many plants which have no leaves, nor roots, nor
flowers, and there are some animals which seem to have all these things
(Figs. 1 and 1<i>a</i>). In some cases they are so much alike (Figs. 2 and 3)
that it has taken the most careful study to decide whether they are
plants or animals.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 166px;">
<img src="images/ill_004.jpg" width="166" height="200" alt="" />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig</span>. 1<i>a</i>.</span>
</div>

<p>Look up into the bright blue sky, and then down at the solid earth
beneath your feet&mdash;you do not find any difficulty in telling, without
taking a moment to think, which is sky and which is earth; but if you
are so happy as to live in the wide open country, or near the sea, or on
a lofty hill, look off and off and off until you see only the delicate
blue haze, like smoke, which divides the heavens from the earth. You can
often see the same thing by looking from the upper windows of a high
house. You will find that many and many a time you can not tell which is
earth and which is air.</p>

<p>Just so it is in the world of nature. You may look at a group of cows
standing under the trees, or watch the merry little grasshoppers
skipping about in the weeds, or catch a bee at his early drink in a
morning-glory bell, and you would laugh if anybody asked you if you
could tell the animal from the plant. But get far enough away from these
common things, and study the animals and plants that need your
microscope to see them, and you would find things so much alike that you
could not tell which was which. Many of these plants have no roots nor
leaves, no flowers nor seed, and many of the animals have no heads nor
legs, no eyes, nor mouths, nor stomachs. In Fig. 4, <i>a</i> is a plant, and
<i>b</i> is an animal. Now how do you suppose anybody knows this? People who
study these things do not <i>guess</i>&mdash;they <i>know</i>. The real difference lies
in what these tiny little creatures do, not at all how they are formed.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/ill_005.jpg" width="300" height="170" alt="" />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig</span>. 2.&mdash;ANIMAL.</span>
</div>

<p>About three-fourths of all the kinds of sea-weed, for instance, are
found to be animal&mdash;not one animal, but a colony. The other fourth are
vegetables. All these used to be considered vegetables; so did the
sponge and the coral and the sea-anemones, and they are all now known to
be animals. Every time you play the game of "Twenty Questions" you have
to think and decide whether the particular thing you have chosen is
"animal, vegetable, or mineral." Have you any notion what makes the real
difference between them?</p>

<p>I imagine that, sooner or later, you will think and say the difference
is that animals can move and plants can not. That will be a very
sensible conclusion if you do come to it, though not a correct one, for
plants do move, some of them very much as animals do; others, and the
greater number, in another way; which all seems very wonderful, and
which I want to talk over next time.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/ill_006.jpg" width="400" height="308" alt="" />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig</span>. 3.&mdash;VEGETABLE.</span>
</div>

<p>What makes the real, deep-down difference is this: Plants can live on
mineral matters alone, on earth and water and air, and these things they
can change into their own flesh and blood, their stems and sap and
fruit. Animals can only live on what the plants have already turned from
dead into living material. We need water&mdash;that is a mineral&mdash;and salt
and air, which are minerals too, if we are to keep alive and well. But
we can not live on these things alone: we should soon die if we had no
food; and all really nourishing food, all that keeps our blood warm and
makes us grow, has once been vegetable. Not one bird, or fish, or
animal, not one single human being, could ever have lived on this earth,
in the air, or in the water, if the plants had not come first, and
prepared the earth for us to live in.</p>

<p>These are "sure enough" fairies that are forever working their wonders
for us. The roots, like elves, grope down in the earth, and gather its
treasures; the leaves stretch out into the air, and gather its riches,
and out of what they have collected they weave the beautiful flowers and
delicious fruits and golden grain.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/ill_007.jpg" width="400" height="181" alt="" />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig</span>. 4.</span>
</div>

<p>I should like to make very clear just the way they do this: it is very
wonderful and beautiful to study how they work their spells. First, the
root, as we have seen before, with its little helmet, bores its way down
into the earth. If it finds no water or damp earth it soon wilts and
dies, but if it finds a wet place it begins to soak up moisture. Besides
the water, it sucks up all the parts of the earth that are dissolved in
the water. The water it <i>must</i> have, and it will manage to live awhile
on that alone, as Dr. Tanner did, but it can not live so very long. Poor
ground means ground that has little or no plant food in it.</p>

<p>You know, if you ever did any gardening work, that you can stick a
cutting of geranium or begonia into pure sand that has no nourishment at
all in it, and that if you keep it well watered the cutting will strike
out roots and bear leaves. This is, in fact, the best way to start
cuttings, for mould is a little apt to rot the stem, but the sand
preserves it. After a while the baby plant is tired of doing nothing but
sucking, and cries for some stronger food. Then you must put it into
rich earth, still giving it plenty of water. The roots, like the baby's
stomach, will at first be satisfied with a very milk-and-watery diet,
but after a while it must have a strengthening soup.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/ill_008.jpg" width="400" height="161" alt="" />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig</span>. 5.</span>
</div>

<p>The roots bring the plant a good deal, but the leaves are the principal
feeders. You remember, perhaps, reading about the millions of little
mouths the plant has all over its leaves. These mouths bring both food
to nourish and air to sustain the plant. A fish keeps itself alive by
sucking the water it lives in all the while through its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_708" id="Page_708">[Pg 708]</a></span> gills. It gets
out of the water whatever it needs&mdash;air and some food. The plants are
like fishes; their water is the great ocean of air that lies on the
surface of the earth. They draw it in through their mouths, take out of
it all they need, and then breathe the rest out again.</p>

<p>In Fig. 5 you see a piece of a liverwort leaf cut down through the
mouth, and in Fig. 6 another kind, a blue-flag (<i>l l</i>, lips; <i>h h</i>,
hollow of the mouth).</p>

<p>Air is a curious mixture. It is a gas made of several gases stirred
together as you stir tea and milk and sugar. One of these gases is
called oxygen (don't be afraid of the hard names); that is what keeps us
alive. I won't give you the name of the next, because it is only used,
like the milk, to weaken the tea. The third is a very disagreeable and
dangerous gas, called <i>carbonic acid gas</i>. It is this last that makes
your head ache in a crowded room or car. This is what you hear of every
now and then as <i>choke-damp</i>, which suffocates people down in mines and
deep wells. It is this which comes from burning charcoal, and makes it
sure death to burn it in a closed room. There is very little of this
dangerous stuff even in close air. Carbonic acid gas, though so
poisonous, is made up of two things, which are very good and perfectly
harmless when they are separated&mdash;carbon and the life-giving oxygen.
Carbon is coal, or something like coal. United together, these two
harmless things make a dreadfully dangerous one, just as innocent
saltpetre, sulphur, and charcoal unite to form the deadly gunpowder.</p>

<p>Now notice how beautifully plants and animals are made to live together
and help each other. Animals breathe in the air, and help themselves to
the oxygen which keeps them alive, but breathe out the deadly carbonic
acid gas. Plants breathing the air separate by some wonderful power of
their own the carbonic acid gas into carbon and oxygen, help themselves
to the carbon, and breathe out the oxygen. What plants consume we throw
away as useless, and what plants breathe out sustains our life. That is
the reason why the country is apt to be so much more healthy than the
city. The air that is poisoned by people and fires becomes purified by
plants.</p>

<p>Unlike the fairies of the story-book, who do all their good deeds by
night, these little plant fairies work only by the light. The sun is
their master, and his first ray is their call from sleep. They set to
work in a minute, separating the dangerous carbonic acid gas into carbon
and oxygen; and while they use the carbon and grow by it as you do by
your food, they are giving back the sweet pure oxygen to the air. All
day long they are at their good work; but when the sun sinks behind the
hills, they do not need any sunset gun to tell them their time of rest
has come. They drop work at once, and drop their fairy ways; they begin
right away to behave as the animals do&mdash;to breathe in oxygen and breathe
out the hateful carbonic acid. That is the reason it is not healthy to
sleep in a room with flowers at night, though they are so good to have
in the daytime.</p>

<p>We owe our lives to the plants&mdash;the food we eat, the pure air we
breathe, as well as much of the rain that falls from heaven. They are
ministering angels, and the loving, tender heavenly Father has appointed
them their work to do&mdash;to beautify the earth and purify the air under
the guidance of the glorious sun, which He has created, and which He
keeps in its appointed path.</p>

<h3>BY W.&nbsp;L. ALDEN,</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">Author of "The Moral Pirates," "The Cruise of the 'Ghost,'" etc., etc</span>.</h4>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chapter IV</span>.</h3>

<p>From the books they had read, Harry and Joe had learned exactly what to
do in case of capsizing under sail, and had often discussed the matter.
"When I capsize," Harry would say, "I shall pull the masts out of her,
and she'll then right of her own accord. Then I shall unship the rudder,
put my hands on the stern-post, and raise myself up so that I can
straddle the deck, and gradually work my way along until I can get into
the cockpit. After that I shall bail her out, step the masts, and sail
on again." Nothing could be easier than to describe this plan while
sitting in a comfortable room on shore, but to carry it out in a rough
sea was a different affair.</p>

<p>Harry was not at all frightened when he found himself in the water, and
he instantly swam clear of the canoe to avoid becoming entangled in her
rigging. He then proceeded to unship the masts and the rudder, and when
this was done, tried to climb in over the stern. He found that it was
quite impossible. No sooner would he get astride of the stern than the
canoe would roll and throw him into the water again. After half a dozen
attempts he gave it up, and swimming to the side of the canoe, managed
to throw himself across the cockpit. This was the way in which Charley
Smith had climbed into his canoe the day before, and to Harry's great
surprise&mdash;for no such method of climbing into a canoe had been mentioned
in any of the books he had read&mdash;it proved successful.</p>

<p>Of course the deck of the canoe was now level with the water, which
washed in and out of her with every sea that struck her. Harry seized
the empty tin can which he used as a bailer, and which was made fast to
one of the timbers of the canoe with a line to prevent it from floating
away, but he could not make any headway in bailing her out. The water
washed into her just as fast as he could throw it out again, and he
began to think that he should have to paddle the canoe ashore full of
water. This would have been hard work, for with so much water in her she
was tremendously heavy and unwieldy; but after getting her head up to
the wind with his paddle, he found that less water washed into her, and
after long and steady work, he succeeded in bailing most of it out.</p>

<span class="caption">NOT SO EASY AS IT LOOKS.</span>
</div>

<p>Meanwhile Charley, whose help Harry had declined, because he felt so
sure that he could get out of his difficulty by following the plan that
he had learned from books on canoeing, was trying to help Joe. At first
Joe thought it was a good joke to be capsized. His Lord Ross
lateen-sail, with its boom and yard, had floated clear of the canoe of
its own accord, and as the only spar left standing was a mast about two
feet high, she ought to have righted. But Joe had forgotten to lash his
sand-bag to the keelson, and the result was that whenever he touched the
canoe she would roll completely over, and come up on the other side. Joe
could neither climb in over the stern nor throw himself across the deck,
and every attempt he made resulted in securing for him a fresh ducking.
Charley tried to help him by holding on to the capsized canoe, but he
could not keep it right side up; and as Joe soon began to show signs of
becoming exhausted, Charley was about to insist that he should hang<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_710" id="Page_710">[Pg 710]</a></span> on
to the stern of the <i>Midnight</i>, and allow himself to be towed ashore,
when Tom in the <i>Twilight</i> arrived on the scene.</p>

<p>Tom had seen the <i>Dawn</i> and the <i>Sunshine</i> capsize, and was far enough
to leeward to have time to take in his sail before the squall reached
him. It therefore did him no harm, and he paddled up against the wind to
help his friends. It took him some time to reach the <i>Dawn</i>, for it blew
so hard that when one blade of the paddle was in the water, he could
hardly force the other blade against the wind. Before the cruise was
over he learned that by turning one blade at right angles to the
other&mdash;for the two blades of a paddle are joined together by a ferrule
in the middle&mdash;he could paddle against a head-wind with much less labor.</p>

<p>The <i>Twilight</i>, being an undecked "Rice Lake" canoe, could easily carry
two persons, and, with the help of Charley and Tom, Joe climbed into
her. Charley then picked up the floating sail of the <i>Dawn</i>, made her
painter fast to his own stern, and started under paddle for the shore.
It was not a light task to tow the water-logged canoe, but both the sea
and the wind helped him, and he landed by the time that the other boys
had got the camp fire started and the coffee nearly ready.</p>

<p>"Well," said Harry, "I've learned how to get into a canoe to-day. If I'd
stuck to the rule, and tried to get in over the stern, I should be out
in the lake yet."</p>

<p>"I'm going to write to the London <i>Field</i> and get it to print my new
rule about capsizing," said Joe.</p>

<p>"What's that?" asked Charley. "To turn somersaults in the water? That
was what you were doing all the time until Tom came up."</p>

<p>"That was for exercise, and had nothing to do with my rule, which is,
'Always have a fellow in a "Rice Lake" canoe to pick you up.'"</p>

<p>"All your trouble came from forgetting to lash your ballast bag,"
remarked Harry. "I hope it will teach you a lesson."</p>

<p>"That's a proper remark for a Commodore who wants to enforce
discipline," cried Charley; "but I insist that the trouble came from
carrying too much sail."</p>

<p>"The sail would have been all right if it hadn't been for the wind,"
replied Harry.</p>

<p>"And the wind wouldn't have done us any harm if we hadn't been on the
lake," added Joe.</p>

<p>"Boys, attention!" cried Harry. "Captain Charles Smith is hereby
appointed sailing-master of this fleet, and will be obeyed and respected
accordingly, or, at any rate, as much as he can make us obey and respect
him. Anyhow, it will be his duty to tell us how much sail to carry, and
how to manage the canoes under sail."</p>

<p>"This is the second day of the cruise," remarked Joe, an hour later, as
he crept into his blankets, "and I have been wet but once. There is
something wrong about it, for on our other cruises I was always wet
through once every day. However, I'll hope for the best."</p>

<p>In the middle of the night Joe had reason to feel more satisfied. It
began to rain. As his rubber blanket was wet, and in that state seemed
hotter than ever, Joe could not sleep under the shelter of it, and, as
on the previous night, went to sleep with nothing over him but his
woollen blanket. His head was underneath the deck, and as the rain began
to fall very gently, it did not awaken him until his blanket was
thoroughly wet.</p>

<p>He roused himself, and sat up. He was startled to see a figure wrapped
in a rubber blanket sitting on his deck. "Who's there?" he asked,
suddenly. "Sing out, or I'll shoot!"</p>

<p>"You can't shoot with a jackknife or a tin bailer, so I'm not much
afraid of you," was the reply.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's you, Tom, is it?" said Joe, much relieved.</p>

<p>"My canoe's half full of water, so I came out into the rain to get dry."</p>

<p>"Couldn't you keep the rain out of the canoe with the rubber blanket?"</p>

<p>"The canoe is fourteen feet long, and hasn't any deck, and the blanket
is six feet long. I had the blanket hung over the paddle, but of course
the rain came in at the ends of the canoe."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm pretty wet, for I didn't cover my canoe at all. What'll we
do?"</p>

<p>"Sit here till it lets up, I suppose," replied Tom. "It must stop
raining some time."</p>

<p>"I've got a better plan than that. Is your rubber blanket dry inside?
Mine isn't."</p>

<p>"Yes, it's dry enough."</p>

<p>"Let's put it on the ground to lie on, and use my rubber blanket for a
tent. We can put it over a ridge-pole about two feet from the ground,
and stake the edges down."</p>

<p>"What will we do for blankets? It's too cold to sleep without them."</p>

<p>"We can each borrow one from Harry and Charley. They've got two apiece,
and can spare one of them."</p>

<p>Joe's plan was evidently the only one to be adopted; and so the two boys
pitched their little rubber tent, borrowed two blankets, and crept under
shelter. They were decidedly wet, but they lay close together, and
managed to keep warm. In the morning they woke up, rested and
comfortable, to find a bright sun shining and their clothes dried by the
heat of their bodies. Neither had taken the slightest cold, although
they had run what was undoubtedly a serious risk, in spite of the fact
that one does not easily take cold when camping out.</p>

<p>As they were enjoying their breakfast, the canoeists naturally talked
over the events of the previous day and night. Harry had been kept
perfectly dry by his canoe tent, one side of which he had left open, so
as to have plenty of fresh air; and Charley had also been well protected
from the rain by his rubber blanket, hung in the usual way over the
paddle, although he had been far too warm to be comfortable.</p>

<p>"I'm tired of suffocating under that rubber blanket of mine, and I've
invented a new way of covering the canoe at night, which will leave me a
little air to breathe. I'll explain it to you when we camp to-night,
Joe."</p>

<p>"I'm glad to hear it, for I've made up my mind that I'd rather be rained
on than take a Turkish bath all night long under that suffocating
blanket."</p>

<p>"Will your new plan work on my canoe?" asked Tom.</p>

<p>"No; nothing will keep that 'Rice Lake' bath-tub of yours dry in a rain
unless you deck her over."</p>

<p>"Now that we've had a chance to try our sails, which rig do you like
best, Sailing-master?" asked Harry.</p>

<p>"That lateen-rig that Joe has," replied Charley. "He can set his sail
and take it in while the rest of us are trying to find our halyards. Did
you see how the whole concern&mdash;spars and sail&mdash;floated free of the canoe
of their own accord the moment she capsized?"</p>

<p>"That's so; but then my big balance-lug holds more wind than Joe's
sail."</p>

<p>"It held too much yesterday. It's a first-rate rig for racing, but it
isn't anything like as handy as the lateen for cruising; neither is my
standing-lug. I tried to get it down in a hurry yesterday, and the
halyards jammed, and I couldn't get it down for two or three minutes."</p>

<p>"I can get my leg-of-mutton in easy enough," remarked Tom, "but I can't
get the mast out of the step unless the water's perfectly smooth, and I
don't believe I could then without going ashore."</p>

<p>"Now, Commodore," said Charley, "if you'll give the order to start, I'll
give the order to carry all sail. The breeze is light and the water is
smooth, and we ought to run down to the end of the lake by noon."</p>

<p>The little fleet made a beautiful appearance as it cruised down the lake
under full sail. The breeze was westerly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_711" id="Page_711">[Pg 711]</a></span> which fact enabled the canoes
to carry their after-sails&mdash;technically known as "dandies"&mdash;to much
advantage. When running directly before the wind the "dandy" is
sometimes a dangerous sail, as it is apt to make the canoe broach to;
but with a wind from any other direction than dead aft it is a very
useful sail.</p>

<p>The canoes sailed faster than they had sailed the day before, because
there was no rough sea to check their headway. They reached Magog at
noon, and went to look at the dam which crosses the Magog River a few
rods from the lake, and wondered how they were ever to get through the
rapids below it.</p>

<p>There was a place where the canoes could be lowered one by one over the
breast of the dam, but the rapids, which extended from below the dam for
nearly a quarter of a mile, were very uninviting to a timid canoeist.
The water did not seem to be more than three or four feet deep, but it
was very swift, and full of rocks. "You boys can't never run them rapids
in them boats," said a man who came to look at the canoes.</p>

<p>The boys did not like to be daunted by their first rapid, and as there
did not seem to be much risk of drowning, they decided to take the
chances of getting the canoes through it safely. Harry gave the order to
lash everything fast in the canoes that could be washed overboard, and
he prepared to lead the way in the <i>Sunshine</i>.</p>

<p>It was magnificent sport shooting down the rapid like an arrow. The
canoes drove through two or three waves which washed the decks. Harry's
and Charley's canoes each struck once while in the rapid, but in each
case only the keel struck the rock, and the current dragged the canoes
safely over it. Every one was delighted with the way his canoe had
acted, and with the skill with which he had avoided this or that rock,
or had discovered the best channel just at the right moment. In their
excitement they let the canoes float gently down the stream, until they
suddenly discovered another rapid at the beginning of a sharp bend in
the river just ahead of them.</p>

<p>It was nothing like as fierce in appearance as the first rapid, and as
Harry led the way, the others followed close after him, one behind the
other, fancying that they could run the rapid without the least trouble.
Half-way down Harry's canoe struck on a rock, swung broad-side to the
current, and hung there. Tom was so close behind him that he could not
alter his course, and so ran straight into the <i>Sunshine</i> with a
terrible crash. The <i>Dawn</i> and the <i>Twilight</i> instantly followed, and as
the four canoes thus piled together keeled over and spilled their
occupants into the river, it began to look as if the rapid had
determined to make the irreverent young canoeists respect it.</p>

<h3>BY ANNETTE NOBLE.</h3>

<h3>Part II.</h3>

<p>It was a spring evening, so very fair that even Billy Knox had taste
enough to be pleased with the robins, the hedges, and the May blossoms.
He was halting on his way home, under the tree into which he had fallen
eight months before. The balloon was not there; its owner had it back
long ago.</p>

<p>That Billy had a home is to be accounted for in this way: The evening
after Peter, the tailor, took him in to supper, he remained overnight,
and after breakfast he went out and milked the cow. He walked to the
woods and chopped fuel enough for a week. Then he staid to dinner.
During the afternoon he found three cents in what was left of his
trousers pocket, and he put that at once into the family treasury. In
the days that followed he haunted the next town, a larger one than
Langham. Whenever he earned anything he returned with it to the red
house with the sunflowers, where, without any talk about it, he came at
last to consider himself at home. He brought in as much as he ate. He
amused little Ben, and made his life much more exciting. Peter did not
care how long he staid so that he paid his way.</p>

<p>On this particular evening Billy seemed in the highest spirits. He
leaped up joyously and hung from the branches of the tree. He was
prancing about like a colt, when down the lane came a man, but not
Peter. This time it was Squire Ellery, who owned the house in which
Peter lived. He was a hard-working, quiet-appearing farmer, respected by
everybody.</p>

<p>"I ain't going to do it," exclaimed the boy, hastily.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do instead?" asked the man. "Are you going to
grow up a loafer and turn out a tramp?"</p>

<p>"No; I have got something prime on hand that suits me exactly."</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"Well," began Billy, "you know the Annerly Minstrel Troupe, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know of them."</p>

<p>"They stay in the town all winter, but summers they go travelling around
the country. I have been helping them for nothing lately&mdash;odd jobs off
and on&mdash;and they like me. Once when the 'end-man' was sick I took his
place at the last minute, and I made so much fun that the manager said
he would take me along this summer and make a crack performer of me. He
will give me some clothes, and when I get valuable to him he will pay me
well. Ain't that something like?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Billy Knox, it is something like&mdash;something like a monkey, more
like a fool&mdash;for you to smut your face, to tell silly jokes, to grin and
giggle and dress up in petticoats at night, that you may learn to swear
and drink and gamble by day. That is what it is like exactly."</p>

<p>The farmer laid his hard hand on the boy's red head, but his voice was
soft as he said, kindly: "Take more time to think it all over, Billy.
Remember, I promise to feed, clothe, and send you to school winters, and
when you get valuable to me I will also pay you wages. Your work will be
hoeing corn and potatoes instead of braying like a donkey or thrumming
on a banjo; but you will respect yourself a good deal more. It will be
better to wash the sweat of honest labor off your face than to be
smearing it into a blackamoor's. I will help you make a man of yourself
if you are only willing and ready, Billy."</p>

<p>The boy thought of dull days in the fields, with oxen for companions;
then of foot-lights, gay music, and laughter. He rubbed his boots on the
grass and muttered, "Much obliged, Mr. Ellery, but I ain't ready for
<i>that</i>, nor willing either, in your way of doing it."</p>

<p>"Very well; I have said all I am going to say. I shall never ask you
again."</p>

<p>Billy trudged home rather soberly. He opened the cottage door a little
later, and at his footfall Ben sprang from the pantry and stood
anxiously watching his pockets. Billy knew exactly what it meant. Ben
had gone to the cupboard, "And when he got there the cupboard was bare."
This had often happened of late. Billy pulled out of one pocket a few
slices of bacon, and out of another a tiny paper of tea, saying:
"Granny, I have got you some to-night&mdash;tea, granny."</p>

<p>"Oh yes. When you were in your cradle, I told my husband you would live
to take care of me."</p>

<p>"She thinks you are father," stuttered Ben, as he got out the
frying-pan. Soon the whole place was filled with the welcome odor of
bacon and tea. Billy cut some bread, and seizing granny's chair, pushed
it to the table. He stared at her while she asked her blessing, and idly
watched the sunbeams in the rusty lace of her old cap. When she opened
her eyes, which were as blue as a baby's, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_712" id="Page_712">[Pg 712]</a></span> added, tenderly: "God
bless you, dear. You brought us a good supper."</p>

<p>It was seldom that she spoke so coherently, but a bit of a prayer often
seemed to clear for a moment her mind, as a precious drop might act in
some unsettled mixture.</p>

<p>"What if granny should not have any supper some night when I am gone?"
was the thought that rushed into the boy's mind, and into his eyes came
tears. His heart was touched by the thought. What preachers and teachers
and offers of help had never been able to effect, the trustful gratitude
of a feeble little old woman had accomplished. He choked, spluttered,
and pretended he had swallowed the tea the wrong way. Then he did like
unto sinners the world over&mdash;he tried to harden his heart again. He
reflected that this was Peter's home and Peter's mother. It was Peter's
business to support his own family. It was Billy's business to rise in
the world.</p>

<p>After supper he made ready for certain exercises very common in the
cabin of late&mdash;exercises which he considered likely to improve him in
his chosen "profession." He pushed granny's chair back into the
chimney-corner, and waited until she dozed before he exclaimed, "Come,
Ben!"</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/ill_011.jpg" width="500" height="443" alt="" />
<span class="caption">BILLY AND BEN REHEARSING.</span>
</div>

<p>Poor Ben! his face grew more mournful than ever. It was no longer any
fun for him, but he patiently consented, and arranged the stage
"properties." He tied on his own and Billy's black masks and their stiff
paper collars, wishing much that his own did not so savagely cut his
poor little ears. He then sat meekly down at the end of the semicircle
of seats, and solemnly got off all the laboriously learned jokes that
his stammering tongue could compass. He surrendered himself to Billy in
a waltz that made every lock of his lint-white hair fly out straight,
and which finally left him breathless under the table legs.</p>

<p>Well, after Ben had been, with some changes of costume, a giraffe, a
Zulu, a Broadway belle, and a propounder of conundrums, he became so
incapable of being anything else but a tired little boy that Billy
relented, and let him lie on the ragged old lounge. In the quiet that
followed, the older boy's brain began to work upon a question that
worried him much. Should he go on a farm, or should he follow his own
fascinating plan? He waked up Ben, and told, in a most engaging way, of
the wonderful minstrel career which opened before him, and he reported
Squire Ellery's offer, but not his words of disapproval. Now Ben, who
was but eight years old, had his own thoughts, and all the more of them
that he gave so few away in words.</p>

<p>"If it was me," said little Ben, promptly, if somewhat sleepily, "I
would rather be out in the sunlight making th-th-things gr-gr-grow.
Wheat fields are so pretty, and I like ca-ca-cattle. They always seem to
know me if I co-co-come near them. I never would dance until I got dizzy
if I could help it. I think it is si-si-silly; it ain't being a man."</p>

<p>Billy gazed at Ben, somewhat surprised. Here were words almost like
Squire Ellery's coming as if they were quoted from out of this
Hop-o'-my-Thumb.</p>

<p>"Ben," he said, "you don't really know anything about minstrel shows.
Some day I will take you to the regular thing."</p>

<p>"I would rather stay here and read to granny. I should be afraid."</p>

<p>"Stay, then, you little coward!" said Billy, roughly.</p>

<p>Granny dozed and snored softly; the lean cat sprang into Ben's arms, and
they slept peacefully together; while Billy walked the room, and peered
out of the window-panes. He half decided that he would go to the farmer
in the morning. Then he half decided he never would go. At last granny
awoke, and said, "Bring the Book and read good words; we have had enough
of this day."</p>

<p>Ben would not wake up. He really could not do so after his hard evening
exercises; and when Billy shook him, the cat took Ben's part, and
scratched Billy resentfully.</p>

<p>"Well, I would as soon read as to hear him stutter over it," said the
older boy, getting the Bible, the cover of which had been bright and
fresh when granny had been so herself. Now it was as nearly out of its
binding as was her soul.</p>

<p>"'The children of Ephraim, being armed, and carrying bows, turned back
in the day of battle,'" read Billy, just where he opened the Book. Then
he asked, "Wouldn't they fight?"</p>

<p>"Able but not willing to do what a body ought to do. I don't remember
about the fighting. Perhaps it was only to endure something. Now I will
go to bed," said granny, forgetting that Billy had read but one verse.</p>

<p>When he was left alone, he sat and pondered on those children of Ephraim
until Peter tumbled into the house in his usual state. Then he let Ben
sleep on, and he himself helped the tailor to bed, doing it with much
less ceremony than the latter approved of.</p>

<h2><a name="BADMINTON" id="BADMINTON">BADMINTON.</a></h2>

<h3>BY SHERWOOD RYSE.</h3>

<p>It is first cousin to lawn tennis, and it is so like lawn tennis that
any one would guess that the two games were closely related. Perhaps
most boys and girls would say that Badminton is a slow game, and very
childish; and, compared with lawn tennis, perhaps it is. But although it
is by no means so robust a game, and requires not nearly so much skill
as its cousin, it has many advantages. Lawn tennis is an out-door game,
and demands a great deal of space and the best possible light; otherwise
it gets sulky. Badminton, on the other hand, can put up with a small
space and a moderately good light. Being, as we have said, less robust
than the other game, wind does not agree with it. Nevertheless, in still
weather it can be played out-of-doors, and in-doors in all weathers.</p>

<p>The small space required is a great advantage that Badminton enjoys. A
large part of the population of this great country lives in city houses,
whose back yards are perhaps fifty feet long and only half as wide. Not
much in the way of games can be done in a city back yard; yet one can
play Badminton there. What if it be planted with posts on which the
laundress stretches her clothes-line? So much the better. We shall want
those posts, if they are conveniently placed, for we have a net to
spread. This should be fastened to the posts so that the top of it is
five feet from the ground, and a net (or a strip of calico) two feet
wide, and as long as the distance between the posts, will be quite large
enough.</p>

<p>The court may be marked out with whitening or chalk, and should measure
about twenty feet by fifteen on each side of the net. At a distance of
five feet from the net, on each side, the service lines are drawn, and
then the court is complete.</p>

<p>The implements of the game are merely battledores and shuttlecocks. Very
babyish, you will say. But if you can once overcome your pride, and
condescend to use such playthings, you will find that the game is not
nearly so babyish as you may think it. The battledores should be good
ones, strong and heavy, and strung either with catgut, like a tennis
racket, or with string. The shuttlecock is greatly improved by being
made heavy. Those sold in stores especially for Badminton are already
made heavy enough, but the ordinary toy shuttlecocks require a little, a
very little, melted lead poured into a hole in the cork. As the lead
cools and hardens, the cork closes around it, and holds it tight.</p>

<p>The rules of Badminton are very much like those of lawn tennis, except
that every stroke must be "volleyed"&mdash;that is, the shuttlecock must be
struck before it touches the ground, for of course it will not bound.
The "server" must send his first ball so that if it were to fall to the
ground it would fall <i>beyond</i> the service line of his opponent's court,
and not within it, as in lawn tennis. After the service it may be
returned to any part of the opponent's court, and kept up until one of
the players fails to return it over the net, or hits it so far that it
falls outside of the opponent's court.</p>

<p>The game is counted in the same manner as in lawn tennis&mdash;fifteen,
thirty, forty, game; with deuce and vantage, when the score is forty
all&mdash;and the one who first wins six games wins the set. Two, three, or
four persons can play at the same time.</p>

<p>With good players, it will frequently happen that the shuttlecock will
be kept in the air for several minutes without falling to the ground,
and it is interesting to keep count of the number of times that it is
thus returned over the net. At the same time it must be remembered that
the object of the game is to send the shuttlecock so that the opponent
can <i>not</i> return it; hence it will be contrary to the spirit of the game
to encourage long rallies by purposely sending easy returns.</p>

<h2><a name="RIGHT_THROUGH_A_BARN" id="RIGHT_THROUGH_A_BARN">RIGHT THROUGH A BARN.</a></h2>

<h3>BY WILLIAM O. STODDARD.</h3>

<p>"Rube," said Bun Gates, when they came together one day after breakfast,
"did you hear about Squire Cudworth's new barn?"</p>

<p>"Guess there isn't anything more to hear about it. Folks didn't talk of
anything else while he was putting it up. Father said it would hold
horses enough to run a livery-stable."</p>

<p>"That isn't it. I heard all about it at breakfast. The railroad's goin'
to run right through it."</p>

<p>"Right through the barn? I wish they'd run it through the academy, if
'twasn't for spoiling the green."</p>

<p>"It's cut Pop Simmons's orchard right in two, and they've tore away
Widow McCue's pig-pen, spite of all Felix and Biddy could do to stop
'em. Now it's the big barn."</p>

<p>"Biggest barn there ever was anywhere around here. It's just awful. Did
you ever see a railroad?"</p>

<p>"Only the streak they've made along where this one's going to come. I'll
tell you what father said, though."</p>

<p>"What did he say, Bun?"</p>

<p>"He said it was one of old Squire Cudworth's jokes. There was a quarrel
between him, and the railroad, and so he put the barn there to keep it
from coming through."</p>

<p>"It won't do it, Bun. A railroad'll go right through a hill and not half
try."</p>

<p>"Come on, Rube, we'll be late; but father says he guesses the railroad
didn't make anything very heavy out of the Squire's joke."</p>

<p>When the class in arithmetic was called up that fore-noon, Bun Gates and
Rube Hollenhouser went down to the foot of it, one after the other, for
the first time that academy term. When they got there and could have a
good look at each other's slates, they each knew what sort of a picture
the other could make of Squire Cudworth's big barn, with something full
of fire and smoke and steam smashing into it at both ends.</p>

<p>The afternoon wore away, a little at a time, until it was all gone, but
every boy they knew had heard of what was coming to Squire Cudworth's
barn by that time, and at least a dozen of them wanted to go and have a
look at it.</p>

<p>Squire Cudworth was standing at the corner of the barn, a very large,
fat, rosy-faced man, with his hands in his pockets, and he looked as if
he were waiting for something. He chuckled all over, and they could hear
him jingle the money in his pockets as he recognized the boys.</p>

<p>"That's the railroad, boys. Them's the ties, and some call 'em sleepers.
The rails are glued down on 'em. You'll see some men come along pretty
soon with great bundles of iron rails in one hand and pots of glue in
the other. They're 'most here now. By to-morrer night that barn of mine
won't be a safe place for hosses. It's awful, boys&mdash;jest awful!"</p>

<p>"How do you s'pose they'll get through the barn?" asked Bun.</p>

<p>"Can't say. I've kep' 'em off long as I could. That's what I'm here for
now. We don't need any railroad in Prome Centre. That's what I told 'em.
If they'd only dig the creek out good and deep, so it would be of some
use. They wouldn't, though, and I might as well have built my barn right
in the middle of the creek."</p>

<p>Every boy in the crowd was listening to him, but not one of them could
see what there was in it all that made the old Squire chuckle so. Three
or four asked,</p>

<p>"Does it go through on Friday?"</p>

<p>"Day after to-morrer, boys. I shall be out of breath by that time. Have
to go home and go to bed, and put all my hosses in the old barn up on
the hill. You'd all better be here then. Tell all the other boys. Have
'em all come." Chuckle, chuckle, chuckle, and the bunches of keys and
the small change jingled merrily, as if the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_715" id="Page_715">[Pg 715]</a></span> Squire were making fun of
the railroad, or the boys, or of his misfortunes.</p>

<p>"We'll all be here," said Rube. "Boys, there'll be something worth
seeing, sure's you live."</p>

<p>They were most of them at one place or another along the track before
school next morning, and at the noon recess they compared notes of the
matters they had seen&mdash;men spiking down rails with big hammers, for
instance, instead of glue-pots. It was a great time for a lot of boys
who had never seen anything of the kind before, and Rube Hollenhouser
stirred up their envy a little. He said:</p>

<p>"Dolf Zimmerman's been on a railroad. He told me all about it. There was
an accident, too, and he'd have been killed as dead as a hammer if he'd
been there."</p>

<p>"Dolf Zimmerman!" exclaimed a fellow who lived away at the upper end of
the village. "Who cares for him? He's travelled, that's all. This
railroad of ours is going to run right through Cudworth's barn. I guess
he wouldn't want to be riding on it just then."</p>

<p>There was a general agreement with that opinion, but the boys who lived
at places below Zimmerman's store all found an errand in there before
the day was over. Some of them only bought a cent's worth of something,
and looked at Dolf, but three or four asked him questions right out, and
it was Felix McCue who got the most out of him. The Widow McCue never
traded at Zimmerman's, and it was a bold thing for Felix to walk in and
ask of Dolf over the counter,</p>

<p>"What's the price of yer bist Jayvy coffee?"</p>

<p>"Thirty-five cents a pound."</p>

<p>"That's what I wanted to know. Do yiz think it'll be any chaper after
the railroad gits through the barrn?"</p>

<p>"Oh, you get eout! You don't want any coffee."</p>

<p>"Don't I, thin? I don't belave ye know any more about a railroad than I
do meself. Come on, b'yes. He's been humbuggin' ye."</p>

<p>Rube Hollenhouser afterward stood up manfully for Dolf Zimmerman's
reputation as a traveller, and all the cows in Prome Centre went to
their pastures very early the next morning. That was Friday, and it was
to be the last day of the mortal life of Squire Cudworth's big barn, and
there were a good many older people, as well as very young ones, who
were willing to hurry through their breakfasts, and walk over to see
what the Squire was going to do about it. Everybody knew more or less
about the quarrel between him and the railway company, and there was not
a doubt in the minds of his fellow-citizens but what he had beaten the
corporation in every point but the one of keeping his barn.</p>

<p>There he was, when Rube and Bun and little Jeff Gates, and a crowd of
other boys and their brothers and sisters, and some of their fathers and
mothers and aunts and uncles, began to swarm around and look at him.
There was the Squire, indeed, and his face was redder than ever, and Bun
Gates remarked,</p>

<p>"I say, Rube, how he does jingle!"</p>

<p>"Yes, but haven't they made that railroad jingle? They've nailed down
the rails 'most up to the stable-door on each side. If an engine should
come now, it could run its nose against the barn."</p>

<p>"They've got to do it, Rube. They've got to smash it right through."</p>

<p>"I say, Bun, the stable's full of men. They're working at something.
Hear 'em hammer?"</p>

<p>"There's another lot around outside. See 'em?"</p>

<p>"Hear 'em in the barn! Wonder 'f they'd let us in."</p>

<p>"Guess not. I don't want to go in, neither. Hey! What's that?"</p>

<p>Every face in the gathering crowd was suddenly turned toward the north,
as if one pull had fetched them all around at the same instant. Not that
they saw anything, but that the deafest man among them could hear the
whistle of the coming locomotive. It would be the first of its kind ever
seen in Prome Centre, and now it was gathering itself, they all knew,
for a rush down that track at Squire Cudworth's barn.</p>

<p>More boys were coming, and they all asked questions the moment they
could get their breaths after they reached the crowd and had one look at
the barn. It was there yet, and so was the Squire, but there had been
another awful whistle, up north, beyond Pop Simmons's orchard.</p>

<p>"Rube," said Bun, "those fellows are just a-jerking that stable out of
its boots. They're h'isting the roof off now."</p>

<p>"Hear 'em hammering inside? There's something going on. Don't they just
swarm, though, and can't they work!"</p>

<p>It was a simple fact that the railway company had sent a good many men
to take care of the last obstacle in its way, and Squire Cudworth's joke
lasted to the very end. He began to grow redder and redder in the face.
Then he jingled more than ever for a minute, and then he stopped
jingling altogether, for just then it seemed as if the whole side of the
stable was stripped off at a push or two. The roof was already off. One
minute more and the ends were gone, doors and all, and a well-dressed,
gentlemanly person stepped out along the track.</p>

<p>"Boys!" shouted Rube. "There's the railroad now. Inside the stable."</p>

<p>"If they haven't put down a track right where the floor was!" said Bun.</p>

<p>There sounded another tremendous shriek from beyond the orchard, and a
cloud of smoke and steam began to move along over the tree-tops.</p>

<p>"Here she comes, boys!"</p>

<p>"She's a-coming! She's a coming!"</p>

<p>"Hark, Rube," said Bun. "What's that man saying to Squire Cudworth?"</p>

<p>They heard him, and he said it very politely.</p>

<p>"Quick work, eh, Mr. Cudworth?"</p>

<p>"Sharp. Far as you've gone. Think you'll get the whole of it off
to-day?"</p>

<p>"Off? Oh no. Don't you see? We're making a station-house out of the main
barn. Just the thing. Set it up a little higher; that's all. Quite a
saving of money to the company."</p>

<p>"Bun," said Rube, "did you ever see old Squire Cudworth look so angry as
he does now? Guess they must have got the joke on him somehow."</p>

<p>"It'll make him sick if they have."</p>

<p>"Hey! She's 'most got here!"</p>

<p>They were all holding their breaths for the next minute or so, for there
was the first locomotive they had ever seen outside of a picture, and it
was whistling and coughing and ringing its bell and backing and starting
and doing everything but dance, right through where Squire Cudworth's
stable had been.</p>

<p>"Rube, they're not going to pull down any more of the barn."</p>

<p>"Tell you what, though, they never'd have got through the way they did
if they hadn't laid some track inside and knocked the doors down."</p>

<p>"Course they wouldn't. I say, old Squire Cudworth's going home."</p>

<p>"Hear the 'cademy bell! Did you know it was nine o'clock? What'll we say
to Miss Eccles?"</p>

<p>"I don't care so much, Rube. She won't get a roomful till this crowd
gets there. There's about as many girls as boys."</p>

<p>"Black marks all 'round. She's seen a railroad before, or she'd have
been here herself. I ain't so sorry as I was about that barn. Do you
know what's a station-house?"</p>

<p>"I guess I do, but we'd better stop after school and ask Dolf
Zimmerman."</p>

<p>At the supper table that evening, Bun Gates heard his father say to his
mother: "Squire Cudworth? Oh yes, he got a good price for his barn. What
made him sick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_716" id="Page_716">[Pg 716]</a></span> was the railway superintendent thanking him for building
them so nice a station-house, just where they wanted it. He tried to
laugh, but he couldn't, and everybody else did."</p>

<h2><a name="AN_UNDER-GROUND_ESCAPE" id="AN_UNDER-GROUND_ESCAPE">AN UNDER-GROUND ESCAPE.</a></h2>

<h3>BY W.&nbsp;W. FENN.</h3>

<p>Snap, my little fox-terrier, was the most affectionate and devoted dog I
ever remember. It mattered not where I went, he was sure to be close to
my heels, and the thicker the crowd, the closer he kept to them. For the
three years that I lived in London, in all our wanderings I never once
missed him or had any trouble with him.</p>

<p>As far as possible, dogs are prohibited from travelling on the
under-ground railway; but as I had constantly to travel by it from
King's Cross to Paddington, and Snap's habit of keeping close being well
known to the officials, they winked at his accompanying me.</p>

<p>On a certain afternoon, being, as usual, on my way to Paddington, and a
train being due at King's Cross, I made a rush for it, and reached the
platform just as a train was coming into the station.</p>

<p>Jumping into a compartment, I looked to see if the dog was with me, but
to my dismay, as a porter slammed the door and the train began to move,
I observed Snap on the platform, running wildly up and down looking for
me. Suddenly he saw me at the window, but it was too late; and as we
entered the darkness of the tunnel, I heard him give a despairing bark.</p>

<p>I felt angry with myself for not looking after him more carefully, and
resolved to get out at the next station and go back for him. But how had
he missed me? I could not understand it, for he had never done such a
thing before. Five minutes brought us to Gower Street, and a train then
due took me back in another five minutes to where I had started from.</p>

<p>"Have you seen my dog?" I asked of a porter there who knew me.</p>

<p>"Your dog, sir?" answered the man. "Oh yes, to be sure. You left him
behind, didn't you? Well, as the train went into the tunnel, I saw him
jump from the platform and follow it."</p>

<p>"What!" I said; "he wasn't following it when we reached Gower Street."</p>

<p>"Wasn't he? Then I expect he's still in the tunnel. The train went too
fast for him to keep up with it."</p>

<p>"He'll be run over!" I exclaimed, very nervous for Snap's safety.</p>

<p>"Tell you what, sir. I'll go and get permission, if you like, from the
inspector to take a lantern and see if we can find him."</p>

<p>I thanked the man, and he started off to get the necessary permission,
which the inspector gave, after saying something about people having no
right to bring dogs into the station. Together the man and I then went
into the tunnel.</p>

<p>The unaccustomed darkness, to say nothing of the perils of such an
expedition, inspired me with considerable dread, and I kept tight hold
of my guide's arm. When we had advanced some two or three hundred yards
along the under-ground highway, or rather "low" way, the lights of an
up-train became visible. As it went by and we stood still for a minute,
the roar and rattle were not calculated to dispel my nervousness. They
were terrible&mdash;deafening. Immediately it had passed, the porter cried
out,</p>

<p>"Look there, sir&mdash;look; there he goes!"</p>

<p>He was pointing toward the red danger light at the tail of the receding
train, and there, sure enough, was Snap scampering after it at a pace
which no one could have given a fox-terrier credit for. I began to call
and whistle as loudly as I could, but my voice was drowned by the
hissing whir and rattle going on. Just then another engine hove in sight
on our line of rails, and we had rapidly to step back into one of the
recesses, or man-holes, as I believe they are called. When this second
train had shot past us, there again, to our astonishment, was Snap
galloping after it. He had not observed us, of course. We then walked on
some little way further along the tunnel, and in a minute another
up-train passed us, and there once more was the dog behind it.</p>

<p>"How ridiculous," I cried, "and yet how painful, to see the poor little
beast tearing to and fro for dear life in this way! He will surely be
run over before long."</p>

<p>But the reason was obvious: he could not keep up with the speed of the
train, and by the time it had distanced him, another probably passed in
the opposite direction, when, confused by the noise and turmoil, he
turned immediately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_717" id="Page_717">[Pg 717]</a></span> and pursued that. It seemed to me simply marvellous
that he had escaped the wheels even so far in these agonizing efforts to
find me.</p>

<p>As the lights of the next engine came in view, I resolved to give the
last carriage just time to pass, and then to rush out, and, if possible,
to intercept my poor pet, for I expected him again to return with that.
I was not mistaken, and as I slipped from the man-hole in front of the
dog, the porter held his lantern so that its light fell full upon my
form. Snap instantly recognized, me, and with one bound and a breathless
yelp landed on my breast, and clasping me tightly round the neck with
his two fore-legs as if they had been the arms of a loving child, he
rubbed his wet nose excitedly against my face. Terrified well-nigh unto
death, gasping and exhausted, and all the time uttering a plaintive
little wail of delight, he lay almost motionless in this position for
several minutes, while his affectionate heart beat like a small
sledge-hammer against mine. This simple but intense demonstration of
canine devotion, in the gloomy depths of the under-ground, with only the
faint rays of the porter's lamp to illuminate the scene, was very
touching.</p>

<p>"You have got a noble little chap there, sir," said the man, as he led
the way cautiously back to the platform. "He was worth a bit of trouble
to find, and no mistake."</p>

<p>"Quite true, my friend," I answered, "and I'll take good care for the
future to pop him under my arm when I travel on the Metropolitan Railway
again."</p>

<p>"I reckon he won't give ye the chance, sir," said the man. "I know a bit
about dogs, and I shouldn't wonder if he fights shy of the stations
altogether after this."</p>

<p>The man was right, for never since that day have I been able to induce
Snap to come within yards of the head of the railway station stairs.
Coax and cajole him as I will, he always resists. He looks up at me with
such a pitiful expression, as much as to say, "Why, you wouldn't risk
losing me again, would you?" That I have at last conceded the point to
him you will readily understand, for I need hardly add that if I had a
strong regard for my dog before, it has grown into a real and strong
affection now.</p>

<p>I want to tell you about a visit to Mayport, at the mouth of the
St. John's River. My brother and I left here at two o'clock on a
hot day in July, on the steamer <i>Pastime</i>. Arriving at Jacksonville
at three, we had an hour to wait, but at four we stepped on board
the <i>Water Lily</i>, and were soon on our way. We sat on deck,
enjoying the sail. At half-past six we reached Mayport, where we
met mamma.</p>

<p>Early the next morning I took a dip in the river, as I have learned
to swim. It is easier to swim in salt-water than in fresh. The
ocean is only two miles from Mayport, and we picked up on the beach
quantities of sea-weed and shells. My brother found a beautiful
jelly-fish washed far up on the shore.</p>

<p>They are building a great jetty here, but it will not be done for
ten years. Immense granite blocks are brought from New York for the
purpose. There were several kinds, all glittering with streaks of
mica. When the jetty is finished it will be fourteen or fifteen
feet high, or above high-water mark. It will then be cemented all
over the top and sides. The channel is nearly in the middle, and
about two hundred yards wide. The intention is to confine the water
inside, and let it flow only through the channel. Mattresses of log
and brush are first sunk, and then stones are placed in layers on
top of them.</p></blockquote>

<p>P.S.&mdash;Will you please tell me what Wiggles mean?</p></blockquote>

<p>Wiggles are lines forming portions of the <i>outlines</i> of pictures. When a
new Wiggle is given, it is a line which forms part of the outline of a
picture already drawn by our artist. Those who try to solve the Wiggle
problem draw a picture containing this line. Sometimes a little girl or
boy happens to draw a picture which closely resembles the one which was
the artist's idea when he drew the Wiggle which all are attempting.</p>

<p>We must ask Mr. Otis to make his next story end so happily that you and
the other little women who complain of him will be pleased and
satisfied. But we think that both stories conclude in a very natural
way.</p>

<p>I have no pets to tell about, not even a kitty, for my mamma
dislikes both dogs and cats, and is afraid they may become mad, so
she will not let us have them in the house. I suppose she knows
best, because she is so much older and wiser than we children, but
we can't help feeling a little bit sorry. We once had a pretty
little yellow canary, but my uncle Horace took it to visit his
canary and to help it build a nest. His cross old bird pecked off
all our little pet's feathers, and it died. I suppose the old bird
was jealous because ours could sing so well, and just killed it as
Cain killed Abel. Though we have no birds or pets of any kind in
our house, I am glad there are plenty of animals in Lincoln Park,
and lots of birds there in the trees. Cruel boys sometimes frighten
these birds and rob their nests. Can anything be more wicked than
this conduct in boys? A great many sparrows make their home in some
Virginia creepers that cover the front of our house. On Sunday last
there was a great commotion in the vines, and we found after a
while that it came from some old sparrows which were trying to make
their young ones go out of the nest and earn their own living.
By-and-by the young sparrows fluttered out of the vines to some
trees near by, and then the noise stopped&mdash;and so must my writing,
or you will think my letter too long to print.</p></blockquote>

<h3>WHAT TO READ.</h3>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Postmistress</span>,&mdash;What books would you read if you were fourteen
years old, had never been away from home, and were very fond of
exciting novels?</p></blockquote>

<span style="margin-left: 34em;"><span class="smcap">John C</span>.</span><br />
</p>

<p>It is a great pity that you should have formed a taste for exciting
novels at fourteen, but if I were you, I would overcome it by reading
interesting and entertaining books which are true. Fact is often
stranger and more thrilling than fiction. As you have never been away
from home, why not take up books of travel? You can sit at ease in your
own room, or perched in a crotch of the apple-tree, or half hidden in a
heap of fragrant hay, and go with Miss Bird to Japan, with Arthur Arnold
to Persia, with Miss Cumming to the Feejee Islands, or with Du Chaillu
to the Land of the Midnight Sun. There is hardly an out-of-the-way
corner of our globe to which some brave traveller has not gone, and
while reading the story of adventure or peril which the traveller
relates, you will learn a great deal, and will cure yourself of a love
for that sort of reading which is a mere waste of time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A Little Heroine</span>.&mdash;The Postmistress mentions with honor the name of
Edith Baxter, of New York City. One bright afternoon in August, as the
children at the Avon Beach Hotel, Bath, Long Island, were playing on the
shore and in the surf, a little fellow named Harry Lee, five years old,
followed his companions to a float, on which he stepped without thought
of danger. Seeing them dive from it, he did the same. Presently a cry
was heard that Harry was drowning. Edith Baxter, a fearless little
swimmer, plunged in to the rescue, and as Harry came to the surface for
the third time, she caught and held him by his golden hair, and boldly
struck out for the shore. Help came, and the boy was saved. His grateful
parents and the other guests of the hotel presented Edith with a
beautiful gold watch and chain as a token of their admiration of her
bravery.</p>

<p>The season for sitting out-doors in the evening is almost over, but

<span style="margin-left: 21em;">A dragon-fly I'd be to-day."</span><br />

<p>Another: Bring in the word <i>Cobweb</i> in reply to the question, "How would

<p>The game of Twenty Questions is very entertaining. One of the company
leaves the room, and during his absence the others fix upon a word to be
guessed by him. We will suppose Charley to have gone out. The Electric
Telegraph is chosen as the subject for him to find, and he is recalled.
They then proceed in this way:</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Honora</span>. We have fixed on a word. Can you guess it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charley</span>. Is it animal, vegetable, or mineral?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span> (<i>who is asked</i>). Mineral.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charley</span>. Can it buy anything?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anna</span>. I think it can; at least I could buy things by means of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charley</span>. Oh, I guess! I suppose banks can't do without it, Ned, can
they?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Edward</span>. I dare say they find it useful.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charley</span>. Anthony, do you ever keep it in your pocket?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span> (<i>laughing</i>). No; that I don't.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charley</span>. Is it ever put in a purse, Fanny?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanny</span>. No indeed; it is <i>so</i> big.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charley</span> (<i>catching at a new idea</i>). Then I was wrong; it is not
money. Does it cross the sea?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>. Yes. I think it does&mdash;that is, I believe it does sometimes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charley</span>. Does it go very quickly?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Honora</span>. It <i>works very, very</i> quickly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charley</span>. It works? It does not go, then, of itself? Is it used on
railways?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Honora</span> (<i>laughing</i>). Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charley</span>. Does it pull you along sometimes, Mabel?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mabel</span>. No, it does not; but sometimes it causes people to travel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charley</span>. Is it very large?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anna</span>. No; very thin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charley</span>. How long is it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fanny</span>. Sometimes miles long, sometimes very short. I have seen it
not as long as my finger.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charley</span>. What can it be?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span>. It is a very wonderful thing; it speaks without a voice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charley</span>. Ah! and you can tell the hours by it, can't you? But no,
it <i>can't</i> be a clock, for the face of that is round, and it is not
very thin. I know! I guess! It is the "Electric Telegraph."
Anthony, <i>you</i> have helped me to guess; <i>you</i> must go out. But,
Anna, how could you buy things with it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anna</span>. I could send an order by it to a shop.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charley</span>. And when did Fanny see it not longer than her finger?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anna</span>. She saw a tiny piece of the Atlantic telegraph cable, the
first one which was laid beneath the ocean. Aunt Maria had it set a
charm for her watch.</p>

<p>Anthony goes out.</p></blockquote>

<h3>FISHING WITH A LANTERN TRAP.</h3>

<p>A veteran trapper recommends a curious device for fishing at night,
known as the lantern trap. A pine torch or a bull's-eye lantern in the
bow of a boat has long been in use as a means of attracting fish, but an
illuminated bait under water is as novel a mode of fishing as it is
successful.</p>

<p>The bait is easily made. A piece of stick phosphorus the size of a
hazel-nut is cut into small pieces, and placed in a three-ounce glass
vial half filled with sweet-oil. Care must be taken to cut and handle
the phosphorus under water, as it is a dangerous substance to deal with.
After several hours the phosphorus dissolves in the oil and forms a
thick fluid, which in the dark will give forth a bright glow.</p>

<p>Having corked the bottle tightly, attach it to a string and drop it
overboard, as in ordinary fishing. The water around it becomes lighted
up, and many fish will be attracted by the unusual brightness.</p>

<p>Beneath the lantern an ordinary circular net should be let down, and
when the fish are swarming around the light, draw the net up quickly,
and it will go hard with you if you do not bring to the surface a good
haul of fish.</p>

<p>This is a novel and most ingenious mode of fishing, and though there is
very little sport in it compared with that of angling with a rod and
line, it may be useful when, as frequently happens, fish will not bite,
and the night's supper or the morrow's breakfast must be provided for,
lest the young woods-man go hungry to bed, or awake with a keen appetite
to realize that some hours must elapse before he can have breakfast.</p>

<h3>NATURAL HISTORY JINGLES.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></h3>

<p>This very funny game was first suggested by the metre of the little
nursery rhyme intended to teach children to read. Each of the players is
given one letter of the alphabet in order, and has ten minutes allowed
him in which to choose an animal the name of which begins with the
letter that has been given to him, and to write a verse about it in the
style of the well-known jingle, "A was an archer," etc. When the time
has expired each recites his verse. A few specimen jingles are given
below to show that the verses must be made as grotesque and humorous as
possible, much more attention being given to rhyme than to reason:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">A was a curious old ant-eater,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">A very strange and remarkable creetur;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">And if of a sudden he wanted to dine,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">I should not much care if he took one of mine.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">B is a bison, whose rough, shaggy hide</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">Is a comfortable thing when you take a sleigh-ride;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">But when he is in it, not pleasant to meet</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">When he tramples the plain with his swift little feet.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">C is a scaly old crocodile,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">Who lazily sleeps in the mud of the Nile;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">But you never can trust in the strength of his nap,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 19em;">For if you go near him his great jaws may snap.</span><br />

States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
